# template_chart_overlay_on_map

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of template_chart_overlay_on_map is to make available an easy
to use template for plotting charts over a map base.

Code for the template is in `~R\template_bar_on_aus.R`. This code
produces the following map showing population column charts for each
State and Territory in Australia.

Population data is sourced using `readabs`, the shapefiles come from
`strayr` as does the paletter for the charts.
